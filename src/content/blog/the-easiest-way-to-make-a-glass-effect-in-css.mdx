## 1- Create a new div

So first things first we create a new div in our html file and giving it a class name like so:

```html
<div class="box">
  <button class="my-btn">Click me!</button>
  <div></div>
</div>
```

## 2- Remove extra space

Secondly we go to our CSS file to remove all the extra space from the html elements.

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

## 3- Center the content

Adding a beautiful background to the body & align our div to center.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background-image: url("<https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1488718729626-53eaa41c0848?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=633&q=80>");
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  height: 100vh;
```

## 4- Add glass effect

Adding some styling & glass effect.

```css
.box {
  position: relative;
  width: 400px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15);
  box-shadow: 0 0 1rem 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  border-radius: 5px;
  backdrop-filter: blur(15px); /* glass effect */
}
```

This is how the final result looks like ! 💯

For the "Click me" button here is the CSS:

```css
.my-btn {
  cursor: pointer;
  padding: 15px 40px;
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  outline: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 80%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  transition: 0.5s;
}
```
